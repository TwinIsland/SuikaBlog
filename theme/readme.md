# Suika Ultimate Blog Theme
build for ultimate performance, total dependency < 3kb. most vanilla js/css. born to be ultimate.

still under developing...

## Developing
since the theme use SPA router, we must pay a lot of attension on JS developing. Basically, it should contain three part (or less):

```js
// PART 1: function declares

(function () {
    // PART 2: parameter declares
})();

window.currentCleanup = function () {
    // PART 3: cleanup function
}
```
